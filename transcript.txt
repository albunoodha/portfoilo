Greetings everyone my name is Abdulla Farahat AlBunoodha and I'll presenting to you about my Portfolio.

The problem statement was to make my own website and set an simple example so that anyone to make my

own unique ideas. That way it will increase the individual's chance to get hired by a company.

My objectives are to create 4 webpages and they are Home, Resume, Portfolio, and Contact.

The development process has to include a logo of me but I consider

it optional really and I don't have to include a photo about myself. You can actually make my own logo.

A navigation bar to choose one of the webpages.

A home webpage with a greetings message.

Resume section contains a profile about myself with skills and objectives.

A portfolio illustrates my certification, work sample and awards.

Finally a contact section that has input form to leave a feedback about my work.
